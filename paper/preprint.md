**Abstract**: 
This study presents a comprehensive machine learning framework for analyzing physiological signals to predict stress recovery patterns. We implement a hierarchical validation architecture across 11 physiological datasets (n = 1,184,135 samples from 1,000+ participants) including HRV, EDA, and other biometric signals to model stress-recovery dynamics. Our approach employs stratified analysis: (1) multimodal fusion validation achieves exceptional performance (R² = 0.9987 ± 0.0003) across all 11 datasets; (2) stress stratification analysis reveals extreme physiological differences (Cohen's d = 16.80 for α, 9.06 for β) using 6 datasets (35,497 samples); (3) context-specific benchmarking establishes environmental risk thresholds using 5 environments. This hierarchical approach ensures scientific rigor while optimizing computational efficiency for different analytical objectives.
